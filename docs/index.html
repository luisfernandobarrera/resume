            Senior Software Engineer and Engineering Manager with a track record building high-performing teams and shipping complex systems in finance, banking, and data-intensive products.

            <div class="collapsible-content" id="about-more">
                
                    <p>I have a strong drive for building software, leading teams, structuring chaos, organizing complexity. I achieve team objectives by fostering discussions to deeply understand problems and tackle them with a practical, hands-on approach, engage in coding and problem-solving alongside the team, focus on collective success and foster a collaborative environment. I am experienced in building teams and mentoring people.</p>
                
                    <p>I have the strong belief that the success of a team is not only a function of will and skills of the people but also of the culture, the organization, and the management team of the company. Enthusiastic about improving within a team, a company, and myself.</p>
                
                    <p>Skilled and enthusiastic Python programmer with a solid background in Finance, Accounting, and Business Data Applications. Love to design and analyze data through building applications and libraries. I don&#39;t just develop projects, I am proud to craft them.</p>
                
                    <p>Hopelessly curious and eclectic. Love to learn about any topic to solve problems. I use Getting Things Done (GTD) as my personal workflow, practice mindfulness to keep my mind clear and calm while handling stress, and have kept a personal ledger for 10 years.</p>
                
                    <p>If your data or project involves symbols like &#39;$¢£€¥%&#39;, you would probably like to share a coffee with me or interview me.</p>
